            <span class="emphasis">Shibboleth</span> and <span class="emphasis">SAML</span>. The world of
            federated identity presents tough challenges for most IT organisations, a radically different authentication
            and authorisation model can present problems for traditional IT teams. SAML2 enables integration with
            cloud-based services and academic resources in a highly customisable, secure, way. But a cost of that is
            complication and not every institution is able to justify a dedicated team for this services; this is where
            we can help.</p>
